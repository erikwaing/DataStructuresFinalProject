\maketitle

The LP seems like it should be able to be solved by a network flow problem. We note that in a translation of the current LP into a flow will probably involve only integral constraints. Since integral flow problems have integral solutions, this means that the integrality gap in the LP should be 1. However, from experiments, we were able to show that this is not the case. So the LP as is currently formulated cannot be stated equivalently as a max flow problem (or any flow problem where the integrality invariant holds).
