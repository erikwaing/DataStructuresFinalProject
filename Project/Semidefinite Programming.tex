We can simplify the LP by stating it as a quadratically contrained quadratic program.

\[ \min \sum a_{ij} \]
such that for each rectangle,
\[ \sum_{\text{sides of the rectangle}} a_{ij} - a_{x_1y_1}a_{x_2y_2} \geq 0 \]
if $a_{xy}$ is set, then
\[ a_{xy} = 1\]
and all the variables are either 0 or 1. 

In order to solve this using Semidefinite programming, we would need to show that the set covered by the constraints is convex and that the objective is a convex function.

Otherwise, the other method is to relax using reformulation-linearization technique. ???
